# Ditana GNU/Linux

Ditana GNU/Linux is an Arch-based distribution that bridges the gap between user-friendly systems and highly customizable environments. It aims to empower Linux enthusiasts with unprecedented control over their computing experience while maintaining a strong focus on security and performance.

## About Ditana

The name "Ditana" draws inspiration from Ammi-Ditana, a king of ancient Babylon known for his long and peaceful reign. This historical connection reflects our philosophy in several ways:

1. **Stability and Longevity**: We aim to create a Linux distribution that provides long-term stability and support.
2. **Continuous Improvement**: We are committed to building upon the solid foundation of Arch Linux, continuously improving and optimizing the user experience.
3. **Cultural Heritage and Innovation**: Ditana GNU/Linux combines time-tested principles of Linux with modern innovations in security and customization.
4. **Detailed Documentation**: We emphasize comprehensive documentation and transparency in system operations.

## Ditana ISO Builder

This repository contains the Ditana ISO Builder, a core component of the Ditana GNU/Linux project. The Ditana ISO Builder is responsible for creating the installation media for Ditana GNU/Linux, integrating various packages and configurations to produce a cohesive and functional system.

### Key Features of the Ditana ISO Builder:

- **Unified ISO**: One image for both desktop and headless installations.
- **Flexible Installer**: A series of dialogs guides you through the installation process, considering complex dependencies based on your hardware and preferences.
- **Extensive Customization**: From selecting kernel parameters to configuring the desktop environment.
- **XFCE Desktop Environment**: For desktop installations, with pre-installed enhancements.
- **Modular Structure**: Many aspects of Ditana have been separated into individual Arch packages.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Automatic detection and adaptation to your hardware.
- **Enhanced Security**: Pre-configured security features and kernel settings.
- **Performance Tuning**: Intelligent system optimizations for peak performance.

## Repository Structure

This repository (`ditana-installer`) contains the Ditana installer and is based on the `/usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/` directory of the Arch `archiso` package.

- The `archiso` branch maintains the original state of the `archiso` package for easy merging of updates.
- The `build.sh` script in the root directory builds the Ditana ISO.
- Key installer scripts:
  - `airootfs/root/main.raku`: Main entry point for the installer.
  - `airootfs/root/folders/root/chroot-install.sh`: Chroot installation script.
- Ansible playbooks are used for robust and reliable configuration:
  - `airootfs/root/bind-mount/root/enable-arch-multilib-repo.yaml`
  - `airootfs/root/bind-mount/root/configure-grub.yaml`
  - `airootfs/root/bind-mount/root/configure-mkinitcpio.yaml`
  - `airootfs/root/ansible/configure_locale.yaml`

## Ditana Package Management

Ditana follows a modular approach, with many components packaged as separate Arch packages. These packages are available through the official Ditana repository. For a detailed description of each package, please navigate to its GitHub repository.

#### Packaged External Sources

- [kora-yellow-icon-theme](https://github.com/acrion/kora-yellow-icon-theme)

#### Repackaged AUR Contributions

Unlike the packages in previous categories, the following do not have Ditana-specific GitHub repositories. These packages are built directly from the Arch User Repository (AUR) and are provided in the Ditana package repository for seamless installation via pacman:

- [kalu](https://github.com/Thulinma/kalu)
- [python-proxy_tools](https://github.com/jtushman/proxy_tools)
- [python-pywebview](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview)
- [stress-ng](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng)

##### Chaotic-AUR Integration

Ditana utilizes [Chaotic-AUR](https://github.com/chaotic-aur) to streamline the installation process of AUR packages. This integration significantly reduces build times and computational overhead by providing pre-built packages from the AUR. By default, Chaotic-AUR support is enabled in Ditana, but users have the option to disable it during the installation process.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the maintainers of Chaotic-AUR for their invaluable contribution to the Arch Linux community. Their work greatly enhances the user experience by making AUR packages more accessible and easier to manage.

Itâ€™s worth noting that the packages listed in this "Repackaged AUR Contributions" section are not available in Chaotic-AUR. These AUR packages are repackaged for the Ditana repository because they are either dependencies for other Ditana-specific packages listed in the previous categories, or for the Ditana installer. By including these repackaged AUR contributions, we ensure a smooth and integrated experience for Ditana users, maintaining consistency across the entire system.

### Ditana Repository

Main server: https://ditana.org/ditana

The Ditana repository is powered by Cloudflare, which provides caching and content delivery network (CDN) services. This setup offers several advantages:

- Improved global accessibility and reduced latency
- Enhanced reliability and uptime
- Protection against DDoS attacks
- Automatic SSL/TLS encryption

### Using Ditana Packages Outside of Ditana

To use Ditana packages in a non-Ditana Arch-based system, follow these steps:

1. Add the following to the end of your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

   ```
   [ditana]
   Include = /etc/pacman.d/ditana-mirrorlist
   ```

2. Create a file named `/etc/pacman.d/ditana-mirrorlist` with the following content:

   ```
   Server = https://ditana.org/$repo/$arch
   ```

3. Update your package database:

   ```
   sudo pacman -Sy
   ```

You can now install Ditana packages using `pacman`.
